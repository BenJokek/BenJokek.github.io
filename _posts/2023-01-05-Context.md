Imagine if a component were to be nested many levels deep and you wanna pass it props. You would have to pass the props to many other components after reaching it. This specially becomes a problem for certain types of props which are pretty much required by many components in your app. What would be nice is if we could directly send data to the required component without having to manually drill down the props through every level of the component tree.

* Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

* Steps:

1. Create the context
2. Provide a context value
3. Consume the content value

```react
// UserContext.js
import React from "react";

//step 1

const UserContext = React.createContext();

const UserProvider = UserContext.Provider;
const UserConsumer = UserContext.Consumer;

export { UserProvider, UserConsumer };
```

```react
// App.js
import ComponentA from "./components/ComponentA";
import { UserProvider } from "./components/UserContext";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      {/*step 2*/}
      <UserProvider value="Ben">
        <ComponentA />
      </UserProvider>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

```react
//ComponentA.js
import { Component } from "react";
import ComponentB from "./ComponentB";

class ComponentA extends Component {
  render() {
    return <ComponentB />;
  }
}

export default ComponentA;
```

```react
//ComponentB.js
import { Component } from "react";
import ComponentC from "./ComponentC";

class ComponentB extends Component {
  render() {
    return <ComponentC />;
  }
}

export default ComponentB;
```

```react
//ComponentC.js
import { Component } from "react";
import { UserConsumer } from "./UserContext";

class ComponentC extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {/*step 3*/}
        <UserConsumer>
          {(username) => {
            return <div>Hello {username}</div>;
          }}
        </UserConsumer>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ComponentC;
```

You can set a default value to your context. It's set while creating the context. It's passed as an argument to the React.createContext().

```react
// UserContext.js
import React from "react";

//step 1

const UserContext = React.createContext("Ben");

const UserProvider = UserContext.Provider;
const UserConsumer = UserContext.Consumer;

export { UserProvider, UserConsumer };
```

Now you can comment out the provider component in "App.js" and everything still works. You can overwrite the default value as well.

```react
// App.js
import ComponentA from "./components/ComponentA";
import { UserProvider } from "./components/UserContext";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      {/*step 2*/}
      {/* <UserProvider value="Ben"> */}
        <ComponentA />
      {/* </UserProvider> */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Context Type

* Steps:
1. Export UserContext itself.
2. Assign this UserContext to the Context Type property in the class.

Now component B can also render the username.

If your app supports the public class view syntax you can replace "ComponentB.contextType" with "static contextType"

```react
// UserContext.js
import React from "react";

const UserContext = React.createContext("Ben");

const UserProvider = UserContext.Provider;
const UserConsumer = UserContext.Consumer;

export { UserProvider, UserConsumer };

export default UserContext; //step 1
```

```react
//ComponentB.js
import { Component } from "react";
import ComponentC from "./ComponentC";
import UserContext from "./UserContext";

class ComponentB extends Component {

  static contextType = UserContext; //step 2

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        Component B context {this.context}
        <ComponentC />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

// ComponentB.contextType = UserContext; //step 2

export default ComponentB;
```

This looks much simpler compared to the consumer component in tags, why should we not just stick to Context Type? There are two limitations:

1. It only works with class components.
2. You can only suscribe to a single context using "contextType".

Many times in your app you need to read more than one context, in which scenario the consumer component is the way to go and the code to consume multiple contexts looks somewhat like this:

```react
const Content = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Consumer>
      {(theme) => (
        <UserContext.Consumer>
          {(user) => <ProfilePage user={user} theme={theme} />}
        </UserContext.Consumer>
      )}
    </ThemeContext.Consumer>
  );
};
```

You can see that we have two context, "ThemeContext" and "UserContext". The first accepts a function as a child passing in a theme value, within the function body we have another function as a child which provides the user context value. Both of them are then passed as props to a component.
