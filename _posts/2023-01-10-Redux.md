"Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps"

* It isn't tied to React, can be used with React, Angular, Vue or even vanilla JavaScript.

* Stores the state of your app. Consider a React app - state of a component. State of an app is the state represented by all the individual components of that app.

* Predictable in what way? Redux is a state container and the state of the application can change. In Redux, all state transition are explicit and it's possible to keep track of them. In other words, the changes to your app state become predictable.

Why would we wanna use Redux in a React app? I mean, components in React have their own state.

Why do we need another tool to help manage that state?

Consider a React app with several components nested at various levels.

"Component A" has an input field to accept the usernames which are stored locally within the component state. Now it just so happens that a sibling component ("Component B") needs to display the username. How do we send the username from "Component A" to "Component B"? We have to do it the React way which is lifting the component state. The state will now be managed in the parent "Component C" which then provides data and methods as props to "Component A" and "Component B". Now what if a few days down the road you find out that "Component D" also needs to display the username. The solution again is to lift the state up. The state is now managed in parent "Component E". The very next day all of a sudden you find out that you also need to display the username in "Component F". Now the only choice you have is to lift the state to "App" component. As you see managing state in React is definitely not as simple as it seems and to make things worse we have a new requirement, we need to display the username in "Component G". The state is maintained in the "App" component and has to be passed as props through all the intermediate components. Depending on the level of nesting this again can be a frustrating task, not to mention the fact that components which don't need the username prop still have to be aware of it. In the component tree if "Component A" now updates the username, that update goes all the way till "App" component which then starts passing down the updated value as prop to the other components. So in React apps when you have a considerable number of components which share some common state, state managment could become troublesome. This is where Redux will help you out.

With Redux your state is contained outside your components. If "Component A" wants to update the state, it communicates with the State Container. State Container updates the state in a predictable manner and then sends this value to only those components that are in need of that value. How does this happen? We'll understand it when start coding.

At this point if you're familiar with React you might be thinking that the problems we just discussed can be solved by other means as well. We have React Context which allows you to consume props deep within the component tree without having to manually pass it down through all the intermediate components. And if you're familiar with hooks, you might also be thinking useContext + useReducer can pretty much do what Redux has to offer. That's right but in Redux version 1.0 released on 2015 these weren't available.

* Redux will help manage state in a React app.

* To directly use Redux in your React app it's a bit confusing, that's because we have React-Redux package. React-Redux is a library that provides bindings to use React and Redux together in an app.

* When should I use Redux in my React app? At some point in time you are gonna find yourself struggling trying to manage the state in you app, that's the time you can go for Redux.
